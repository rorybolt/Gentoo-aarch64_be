This file has been modified to instruct catalyst how to handle the arm64 big endian architecture. I modified it post install; 
on my system it resides in the following (environment specific) location:
 /usr/lib/python3.9/site-packages/catalyst/arch/
 
 This really needs to be added to the source of the catalyst package.
