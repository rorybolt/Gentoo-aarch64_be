This directory contains a hierarchy of files that must be changed for dracut to correctly handle the new architecture aarch64_be. 
This should really go in to the upstream dracut package, but I just edited them after installing dracut on my system.

On my system this hierarchy is installed at:

/usr/lib/dracut
